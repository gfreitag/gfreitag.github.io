<p>Hello world! I'm a third-year undergraduate, studying Computer Science at McGill University. Every year, I travel from my sunny hometown of San Diego, California to the beautiful (but quite chilly) city of Montreal, Quebec, in order to pursue my interests. I love art, guitar, reading, and of course coding and mathematics. I'm currently looking for possible internships in order to broaden my experiences and learn new skills.</p>
